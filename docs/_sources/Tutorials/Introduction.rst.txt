*MacroQueue*'s user interface has 3 sections: the Queue, the Macros, and the control buttons. There are also the menus and status bar.

Left clicking on one of the macros will bring up a dialog asking for the parameters so you can :doc:`AddToQueue`.

Once a macro is in the queue, you can right click on it to copy, edit, delete, or move.

Once you start the queue, by pressing the button on the left, the button will turn into a "Pause after Macro" button.
