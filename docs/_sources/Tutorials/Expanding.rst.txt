Multiple Parameters
==================================================

Adding Multiple Macros
-------------------------

When inputing numerical parameters, you may simultaneously add several items to the queue in two ways. 

- You may input either 1,3,7,9 or 1;3;7;9 and 4 macros will be added to the queue, each with a different value of the parameter.

- If you want the values to be evenly spaced, you may also input 3 numbers with a format of 'Start, End, Step size'.  Writing 2,10,2 is identical to writing 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

    - You may use a negative step size if you would like to have the values decrease: 0,-10,-1.

    - If you want to input 3 values without expanding them, you may use semicolons instead of commas.  -1;1;0.1 will *not* be expanded.

Which Functions will Run
--------------------------

It is important to note that only the functions after the expanded function are included.  
For example, let's say I want to (1) change the setpoint, (2) wait some time, (3) change the bias, and (4) scan and I want 2 different setpoints and 2 different biases.  

.. image:: ./Expanding6.png


The first and third macro will have all 4 functions while the second and fourth will only change the bias and scan.
